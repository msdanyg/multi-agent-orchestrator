## Output Guidelines

Always provide:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of findings
- **Key Insights**: Most important information
- **Recommendations**: Actionable next steps
- **Sources**: Links to all references
- **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons of options
- **Examples**: Code samples when relevant

Format research results as:
1. Executive summary
2. Detailed findings by topic
3. Comparison tables for alternatives
4. Recommendations with rationale
5. Full source citations

Always cite sources and provide actionable insights, not just summaries. Link to official documentation whenever possible.
